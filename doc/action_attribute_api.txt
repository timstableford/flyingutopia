An action can happen on either sprite interaction or player collision
Attributes or interaction/object type are seperated by a | (pipe)
Actions are seperated by by a ~ (wobbly line thing)
This allows multiple possibilities in each tile.

action: interact|door
attribute: open_time(float)|image_open|image_close|image_opening|image_closing
open_time is the time the door remains open for.
If it is 0 the door will remain open until closed.

action: interact|text
1) attribute: T|I am some text
2) attribute: ID|TEXTID

action: interact|image
attribute: image_name

action: collision|portal
attribute: level_name|x|y


Example 1: A picture with a caption. Caption displayed then image
action: interact|text~interact|image
attribute: T|This is a beautiful painting!~train_painting

Example 2: A door that opens on collision and stays open for 4 seconds
action: collision|door
attribute: 4|image_open|image_close|image_opening|image_closing

Example 3: A Portal leading to the same world ("this" is a special keyword). X and Y coordinates are in grid coordinates.
action: collision|portal
attribute: this|1|1
